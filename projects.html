                                    My very first dive into the game making world was this project. I spent the year of 2006 spare time building over and over again to get the gameplay/look I wanted using a tool called RPG Maker XP.
                                    Eventually I accomplished what I desired. The work was long and tedious. In this project I learned how a game is put together and inadvertently how software development works.
                                    I decided to move onto something else since Just about everything was hard coded and getting it out of Ruby in RPG Maker was starting over.

                                    I won a 48hr company hackathon with this project!
                                    The idea started as a joke to program my project manager's entire job role.
                                    This included lame administrative tasks such as building, deploying, answering questions about application state, and even updating the AGILE framework documentation for auditors!
                                    Very proud of this project. It was glorified and has since been upgraded to V2. V2 is in the process of being integrated into the company on a deeper level.
                                    Small bonus, the presentation went so well that I inadvertently caused executive interest in slack :)

                            <p>The need for this tool arose when I was tasked to co manage over 50 servers with many many services around the clock. I needed something to alert me when things take a turn for the worse. In some cases, I need them corrected automagically without my intervention.</p>
                            <p>It performs regular CLI commands over SSH 2.0 to gather any sort of information you would gather whilst troubleshooting a specific system or service and stores the data in a custom MySQL database.</p>
                            <p>The project took me about 5 months of spare time equating to roughly 60 hours of database design, research, coding and glorious testing/debugging.</p>
                            <p>Cyclops can cross over windows, apple and Linux platforms easily. The amount of sanity this tool has saved me in the workplace has been invaluable. It actually took over part of my job in its final state.</p>

                                    The C# Unity3D code is pretty insane since its my free for all playground. GoLang gets some spotlight here in the form of batch categorize, preorder and reference n hundred images.

                                I went above and beyond my regular system admin duties by writing an entire policy for a company because they did not have one nor anyone on staff who understood both business concepts and technology concepts. I take great pride in the completion of this task since I went in with no fore knowledge on being audited. A plan was also designed by me to take us through the journey that is compliance. The company succeeded with my help. That was pretty sweet.

I had creative freedom here and got to make the course simple, to the point and interactive. The actual migration of the data was made quite simple by Google apps utilities. The data was moved in phases so that our department was not overwhelmed. The entire project took about 45 days.

                                Database magic takes an excel file, converts it into a MySQL or sqlite and back again.
                                It allows for quick schema restructuring by mere peasant mortals who do not know what a database is.
                                This frees up my time to work on my people skills.

It is a versatile object with many possible angles. I built a heavy section staff myself out of wood and practice with it.

                                This was one of my first collaborative game making attempts. We had a team of about 20 people all over the world working together building the game. I myself designed a large amount of the AI/statistics and organized a small group of 3-4 programmers.
                                I have a <strong>TON</strong> of tool concepts that I carried over into my other development projects after this one fell apart.
                                Everything was rolling fine for about 6 months, but then the holiday season came in and people moved, got lazy, died?
                                All of a sudden we had a very large project and no project manager.
                                I learned that a <strong>good</strong> project manager is important because she/he acts like a powerful emotional adhesive when everyone else has their head down working.
                                I heard about migrating geese and how one of their number flies behind the group and yaps at them.
                                The software projects are not so different and benefit from encouragement to move with greater vigor.

                                Certified Information Systems Security Professional. I spent roughly a month of reading various documents such as PCI DSS version 2/3, N.I.S.Ts Special Publication 800-66, and many others whilst writting a security policy from scratch for a company. The first goal was to survive a risk assessment from two auditors and a audit from one additional auditor. I succeeded in that with no experience. So I thought to myself, why not go one step further and get certified? I admit that the dry reading and dull life was not appealing. It didn't take much to discourage that idea from me and move onto something else more exciting.

                                I made two little magnetic turbines. You cannot create energy without work. When a perpetual motion device takes on a load, then it loses the energy it needs to continue its perpetual motion. I think this will only work to reduce work required for continuance at best.

                                The goal was to utilize an open source forum software for a company that needed better communication and orginization. Time was my enemy here. The project never got any real traction. I learned that ideas should be prototyped before delving too deep.

It failed because I never built a front end interface for mere mortals to use. Thus making the tool too complex to succeed, no matter how useful it was to me.

                                I just wanted to use it for something simple. Listen to a socket and parse out the retrieved data. I ended up hating the syntax for dealing with strings after 7 hours. I used python instead and just finished the mission.
